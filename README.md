The Student Management System is a comprehensive software 
solution designed to streamline the administrative tasks involved in 
managing student records for educational institutions. Utilizing 
Python's Tkinter for the graphical user interface and MySQL for 
backend database management, the system provides functionalities 
for adding, viewing, updating, and deleting student records. It 
automates the management of student information, ensuring data 
integrity and ease of access. The system is designed to improve 
efficiency, reduce manual errors, and enhance data security by using 
parameterized queries to protect against SQL injection. By providing 
real-time access to student data and enabling efficient data handling, 
the Student Management System aims to facilitate better 
administrative decision-making and improve overall management of 
student records.
